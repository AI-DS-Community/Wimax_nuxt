        Project Day 2022
      </h1>
      
      <p class="c italic text-justify">
        Our classmates had participated in project day 2022 conducted at Easwari
        Engineering college. We demonstrated our various projects to the
        audience and the faculties such as Gesture Controlled Computer(GCC)
        which involves Image processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine
        learning and Automation. The concept of this project is to control our
        computer system using hand gestures that mimic the mouse controls to
        ease the human-computer interaction. Another project is “MEDOMAXX”. The
        aim of Medomaxx is to develop a health care robot using artificial
        intelligence. The entire project is developed keeping in the view of
        medicating the patients. The robot delivers medicine to the patients
        according to particular disease in regular time intervals. With this
        robot the healthcare workers can medicate the patients without any
        direct contact with them. Next project is an idea about projection of a
        hologram using waveguide holographic optics and control it using Leap
        motion.
